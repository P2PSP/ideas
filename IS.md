# Super-resolution Imaging through High-frequency Subbands Prediction in the Wavelet Domain

## Abstract

Image super-resolution techniques are used to increase the spatial
resolution of digital images. In this idea we propose to use motion
estimation to predict the high-frequency coefficients in the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain, taking advantage of the correlation
between low and high frequency DWT subbands.

## Expected deliverables

A super-resolution image generator, that inputs a single image and
outputs an image with a 2x2 magnification factor.

## Knowledge prerequisites

Python, Git, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Motion Estimation.
